===============================================================================

CURRENT:
* There is so much free space at the bottom, re make the whole bottom section to allow for more drawing area.
* Add ways to hide the menus to allow for more drawing space.
* Add more room for more tools

 Bug test:
* Scissors tool sometimes doesn't paste? <-- FIXED I THINK?!?!?! TEST MORE

    TODO:
    BUGS:
* Fix weird outlining from the fillbucket tool
* Stuff breaks on resizing... currently i know that the graph breaks but maybe
more does as well

!!IMPORTANT
    LOTS OF ISSUES ARE STEMMING FROM HAVING TO HAVE MOUSE ON CANVAS TO ACTIVATE CHANGES
    I INTENTIONALLY MADE IT SO THE MOUSE MUST BE ON CANVAS TO PREVENT PAINTING WHEN ON AN ICON
    PAINTING AND UPDATING SHOULD MAYBE BE SEPERATE TO AVOID THE ISSUES BELOW:
    * Moveable line when changing color whist editing only updates when mouse on canvas
    * When initially clicking the mirror tool, the line is not shown unless hovering the screen.

    FEATURES:
* Add a full screen mode that basically hides all of the tools
* Add infinite scrolling
* In full screen mode add a way to have more than a screen size worth of drawing area
    What do i want? do i want to have a zoom/pan, or a simple scrolling?

* Add a global stroke weight that is shared amongst any drawing tools
* Allow all shapes to be moveable once they are created? 
* Add a way to grab a a box of "elements" and move them
* Add a transition between css buttons so it isn't instant.
* Add an eraser (for object mode & normal eraser)


Make the base of the application look more appealing
* Add a color wheel?
    <input type="color" id="color-picker">
    let colorPicker = document.getElementById('color-picker');
    let hex = colorPicker.value.replace('#', '');
    hex = parseInt(hex, 16);
    let col = [hex >> 16 & 255, hex >> 8 & 255, hex & 255];
    select(".colorPalette").child(colorPicker);
    self.selectedcolor = col;
